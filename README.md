# vehicleCounting

## Description 
Rewrite of my vehicle counter program in C++ (previously in python), this program was used for my final project in college

## Usage
just run 
```sh
./build.sh && ./vehicleCounter
```

actually using build.zig for build system but i dont why but it didnt want to detect libopencv_imgcodecs, so i ditch it for good old shell
